# Python-Sorting-Algorithms
This repository will hold all the classical sorting algorithms.

I included the functionality to test their efficiency against each other by checking their execution time
as a function of the size of the list passed into them. I used matploblib to plot the graphs and included the 
functionality to decide whether to generate numbers along a normal distribution or a pythons randInt function.

The notebook graphs all algorithms against one another.
